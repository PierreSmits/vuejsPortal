Test portlets FindExample and ListExample :

. search by name with contain (data-obj testContain), result: 11 lines (assert with message "testContain 12")
. search by name with BeginWith (data-obj testBegin), result: 35 lines (test with FindAndListExamples.checkTotalFound), so 2 pages test presence of nav-next (assert with message "Pb next button")
. search by id (data-obj testId), result: only one line and id is on list (assert with message "testId link")
. search by exampleType (data-obj testType), result: 25 lines and a next button (assert with message "Pb next button2") click on next-page and check there is 5 line print (assert with message "testType 5")
. search by name with contain (data-obj testContain1), result: less than 20 lines, so nav-next disappear, count number of line
. sort by description (data sortList.sort_0 ) via FindAndListExamples.sortListBy
. sort by name (data sortList.sort_1 ) via FindAndListExamples.sortListBy
. check number of line has not change and first line name equal sortList.result_1
. sort by id (data sortList.sort_2 ) via FindAndListExamples.sortListBy
. check number of line has not change and first line name equal sortList.result_2
